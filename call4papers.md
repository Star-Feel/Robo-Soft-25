<!-- # RoboSoft'25: The 1st International Workshop on Vision-Language in Soft Robot -->

## Call for Papers

This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines to share ideas and methods on soft robot learning. We welcome research contributions as well as best-practice contributions on (but not limited to) the following topics:

- Multimodal robot manipulation in constrained environments.
- Multimodal navigation with mobile robots.
- Learning-based paradigms for soft robot control.
- Multimodal perception and modeling for soft-bodied robots.

All submissions must be original work not under review at any other workshop, conference, or journal. The workshop will accept papers describing completed work as well as work in progress. One submission format is accepted: full paper, which must follow the formatting guidelines of the main conference ACM MM 2025.
